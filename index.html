    <p>Fire Island continues to be a popular Long Island destination throughout the year. There are no blaring horns like nearby New York City because there are no cars. Stars twinkle brighter in the dark skies, and rhythmic waves roll up to beautiful white beaches and towering dunes. The chic and charming beach house and boardwalk ambiance attracts artists, musicians, writers, and actors from all over.</p>
